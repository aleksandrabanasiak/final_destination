## Known issues
**Please refer to this list before you submit a new bug report!**
- Framerate breaks player's movement physics
- One of the stage_1 enemies can somehow become immortal 
- Enemies don't always detect edge of the platform correctly (thus they are walking in the air sometimes)
- You can experience some camera jittering (especially in the Linux build); it's a known 
[Godot's problem](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/misc/jitter_stutter.html). It will be investigated
and fixed later.
